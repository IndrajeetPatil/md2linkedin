# Copilot Instructions

*(This file is based on AGENTS.md)*

This is a Python package repository following standard development practices.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main package code.
- `tests/`: Contains the `pytest` test suite.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation files.
- `pyproject.toml`: The primary configuration file for metadata and tools.
- `uv.lock`: Lockfile ensuring reproducible environments.

## Setup & Dependencies
- We use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast package and environment management.
- **Do not** use `pip`, `pipenv`, or `poetry` directly.
- **Do not** manually edit `uv.lock`.
- To reproduce the locked environment, run `uv sync`.
- To explicitly upgrade dependencies and pre-commit hooks, run `make update-deps`.

## Code Quality & Testing
- Code formatting and linting are handled by `ruff`, and type checking by `ty`.
- Pre-commit hooks are configured via `prek`.
- **Do not** commit code with linting errors, type warnings, or failing tests.
- Always run `make qa` to format, lint, and type-check your code.
- Run `make check-package` to run the full validation suite (QA + Tests + Build).
- **Do not** bypass the `Makefile`; rely on its targets for standardized workflows.

## Contribution Workflow
1. Ensure you are on a feature branch.
2. Implement your code changes within `src/` and corresponding tests within `tests/`.
3. Verify all changes by running `make check-package`.
4. Commit your changes and push to the branch to update the Pull Request.
